      review: "I recently visited Little Lemon restaurant and was blown away by the quality of their meals. The Greek Salad is a must-try—it's light, refreshing, and packed with flavor. The Bruschetta was also exceptional, with the perfect balance of garlic and olive oil. I can't wait to go back for more!",
